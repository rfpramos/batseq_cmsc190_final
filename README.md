# BatSEQ

## Overview of the Project
University of the Philippines—Los Banos (UPLB-MNH) launched the Center for Cave Ecosystem Research (CAVES) that outputted a dataset that contained metadata about the different cave ecosystems in CALABARZON as well as their corresponding RNA Sequences. This study aimed to create a web-based database management system, which is fondly called as BatSEQ, that allowed researchers to communicate their finding to the general public, elevated with incorporation of bioinformatics tools on sequence visualization, phylogenetic tree viewer, and its primary feature: a search tool that would analyze sequence similarities using Basic Local Alignment (BLAST). Upon the completion of the development of the website, it was tested to 11 respondents that are verse on microbial research to assess the accomplishment of its objective. It scored 75.45 in the SUS test, falling under the “Good” category, and a mean of 4.27 in the usability test using a questionnaire that is specified to assess the effectiveness of the website. In conclusion, , it can be inferred from the results of the evaluation that respondents view the system as something that is both usable and useful.



## Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm (included with Node.js)

## Running the Frontend
cd frontend  
npm install  
npm run  

## Running the Backend
cd backend  
npm install  
node server.js

## Setting up the BLAST Database
Use the databse in the Backend for setting up



## Notes
- Run the frontend and backend in separate terminals.
